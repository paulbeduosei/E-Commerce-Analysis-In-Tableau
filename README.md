The data visualizations here reveal key insights into product performance and customer behavior:

📊 Key Findings from the Dashboards

Top Sellers & Volume: The Top Sellers by Quantity list shows the highest-volume items, which are crucial for maintaining inventory efficiency and optimizing the Shipping Baseline.

Customer Value (LTV): We can visualize Customer Lifetime Value (LTV) by State, which is essential for targeted marketing spend and retention strategies.

Market Basket Analysis (MBA): The MBA output identifies high-affinity product pairs, showing exactly which items are frequently purchased together, such as the relationship between "Indoor/Outdoor Games" and another product category.

💡 Strategic Questions & Actions Gained

This analysis directly informs high-impact business strategy:

Cross-Selling & Bundling: Based on the Market Basket Analysis results, what product combinations have the highest Lift and Confidence? This directly informs targeted cross-sell campaigns and product bundling for increased Average Order Value (AOV).

Inventory & Profit Optimization: Are the Top Sellers by Quantity also the Top Sellers by Profit? If not, the strategy shifts to either improving margins on high-volume items or using them as loss leaders to drive sales of high-profit products.

Shipping Cost Strategy: Given the Shipping Baseline figure, can we implement a Free Shipping Threshold (FST) that leverages the high volume of top-selling items to encourage slightly larger orders, thus reducing the effective percentage of shipping cost on total revenue?

Geographic Targeting: Where are the states with the highest LTV? This insight is vital for allocating marketing budget to maximize ROI from the most valuable customer segments.

This project highlights the power of combining descriptive statistics with predictive modeling (MBA) for truly actionable insights!
